*Chrome extension to optimize token usage in LLM chat apps (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)*

**Reduce Tokens. Save Energy. Sustain the Future.**

## What is TokenWhale?

**TokenWhale** is a Chrome extension designed to make everyday usage of LLMs (like ChatGPT) more sustainable by reducing the number of input and output tokens ‚Äî which in turn reduces energy consumption and the water used to cool data center GPUs.

With LLMs becoming deeply embedded in daily workflows, each token processed has a hidden cost. Our goal is to **minimize environmental impact** without compromising user experience.

## Why TokenWhale?

Recent studies show that AI workloads consume massive amounts of electricity and water ‚Äî especially during inference. Every token counts:

- More tokens ‚Üí More GPU cycles  
- More GPU cycles ‚Üí More energy  
- More energy ‚Üí More water to cool those GPUs

If we can **cut down token usage at scale**, we can help reduce this carbon and water footprint significantly.

## How It Works

TokenWhale adds smart features directly into the ChatGPT interface:

### ‚úÖ Prompt Optimizer
- Injects a lightweight ‚Äú**Optimize**‚Äù button above the Send button.
- Uses rule-based logic (no model calls!) to reduce verbose or redundant text in the user‚Äôs prompt before submission.
- Keeps the intent intact, while minimizing input token usage.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Output Limit Controller
- Adds a floating control panel with response length options:  
  `LIMIT 1-2 sentences`, `LENGTH: short`, `RESPONSE: medium`, etc.
- These short-tail directives are **token-efficient** and guide ChatGPT to produce concise outputs.
- Avoids verbose instructions like "Please summarize in short form" that waste tokens.

### üî¢ Live Token Tracker 
- Displays number of queries optimized and total estimated token savings.
- Gamifies sustainable AI usage and rewards mindful behavior.

## üåä Vision

If just 1% of LLM interactions adopted token-saving practices like TokenWhale, the global energy and water savings could be substantial.

TokenWhale aims to **shift LLM usage toward sustainability**, one optimized prompt at a time.
